INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS

Following programs must be present on you system:
  make
  po4a (updates po files and generates translated LaTeX documents)
  LaTeX
  hevea (generates HTML files from LaTeX sources. Optional)

To add a translation to the project add a $lang.po file to the po directory.
$lang is a ISO 639-1 two letter language code (See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).  Then run
  $ make init

Translate the .po file.  To generate translated latex documents in latex/$lang
run 
  $ make gen-latex

Screenshots for latex documents are saved in the images/$language, where
$language is the full name of the target language (e.g. ukrainian).  This full
name also _must_ be the translation for the followin .po entry:

--
#. type: newcommand{#4}
#: latex/en/iTest-Documentation.tex:6
msgid "english"
msgstr ""
--

If you don't want to create screenshots for your language, you can use the
english screenshots by creating a symlink:
  $ cd images
  $ ln -s english $language
